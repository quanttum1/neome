# In this project we use TODOs to plan things we want to do ahead
# and to help maintainers find something to do. A TODO is just a
# comment starting with `TODO(YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS):` or simply `TODO:`
# (the first option is prefered unless it's difficult to generate it
# in your text editor). The timezone doesn't matter as long as we don't
# experience any troubles. In theory, you can use anything as a TODO
# label (e.g. a UUID), but this is the prefered label type.
#
# But in this file anything that starts from `(YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS):` or
# `():` is considered a TODO. TODOs can have several lines (the first one
# is the title).
# If a line starts with `deps:` comma-separated TODO labels are expected.
# For example:
#
# deps: (2025-12-17 21:11:33), (2025-12-17 21:12:48)
#
# This means that the TODO can only be implemented when the referenced
# TODOs are implemented.
#
# You can list all of the TODOs by running `python3 list-todos.py` in
# the root of the project. It will hide TODOs whose deps are still present.
